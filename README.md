## 🔧 Key Changes Made

1. **Framework Migration**: Converted from Astro to pure React + Vite
2. **Routing**: Implemented React Router for client-side routing
3. **Services**: Created mock implementations for Wix services
4. **Authentication**: Simplified member authentication with localStorage
5. **Build System**: Configured Vite for fast development and building

## 🎨 UI Preservation

The application maintains the exact same visual design and user experience:
- All animations and transitions preserved
- Three.js background effects intact
- Interactive testimonials system working
- Responsive design maintained
- All styling and components unchanged

## 🛠️ Development

The application now runs on Vite with:
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Fast build times
- Modern ES modules
- TypeScript support
- ESLint configuration

## 📦 Dependencies

All original dependencies preserved:
- React 18.3.1
- Framer Motion for animations
- Three.js for 3D effects
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI components
- React Router for navigation

## 🔄 Mock Services

The following services have been converted to mock implementations:
- `BaseCrudService` - Content management operations
- `MemberProvider` - User authentication and state
- `getCurrentMember` - Member data retrieval

These can be easily replaced with real API calls when needed.
