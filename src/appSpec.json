It combines a clean, dark UI with interactive elements to tell the story of the people involved. The use of mustard yellow as a primary color adds a vibrant and energetic touch, while the Three.js background provides a subtle, modern feel.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1.  Dark Mode Foundation: The entire site is built on a black background (#000000) to create a sleek and modern aesthetic.\n2.  Hero Section Impact: The hero section features a bold heading, subheading, and a centered CTA button, all styled with the primary and secondary colors for maximum impact.\n3.  Community Storytelling: The community section uses the provided group photo as the main image, with overlaid avatars and interactive thought bubbles. Clicking a thought bubble reveals a testimonial card with animated transitions.\n4.  Three.js Background: A subtle Three.js animated background with floating shapes or soft particles adds a modern touch without distracting from the content.\n5.  Responsive and Accessible: The page is fully responsive and accessible, with keyboard navigation for thought bubbles and alt text for all images.",

When using 'primary' as a background with 'primaryForeground' for text, this combination is ideal for card elements, ensuring visual consistency and clarity. If this combination is used for buttons, the button should include a black border for additional definition and accessibility.

It combines a clean, dark UI with interactive elements to tell the story of the people involved. The use of mustard yellow as a primary color adds a vibrant and energetic touch, while the Three.js background provides a subtle, modern feel.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1.  Dark Mode Foundation: The entire site is built on a black background (#000000) to create a sleek and modern aesthetic.\n2.  Hero Section Impact: The hero section features a bold heading, subheading, and a centered CTA button, all styled with the primary and secondary colors for maximum impact.\n3.  Community Storytelling: The community section uses the provided group photo as the main image, with overlaid avatars and interactive thought bubbles. Clicking a thought bubble reveals a testimonial card with animated transitions.\n4.  Three.js Background: A subtle Three.js animated background with floating shapes or soft particles adds a modern touch without distracting from the content.\n5.  Responsive and Accessible: The page is fully responsive and accessible, with keyboard navigation for thought bubbles and alt text for all images.",

Use the following design guidelines: Background color is black (#000000), primary color is mustard yellow (#FFC300), and secondary color is white (#FFFFFF). The hero section should have a bold heading, subheading, and a centered CTA button. The community section must use the provided group photo as the main image, and overlay 7 silhouettes or avatars (choose any 7) positioned as people within the image. Above each person, place a small, white, cloud-shaped thought bubble button. When a thought bubble is clicked, a unique review/testimonial card for that person should appear on the right-hand side of the screen, styled with rounded corners, shadows, mustard yellow highlights, and white text on a dark background. Use Framer Motion for animated transitions of the review cards. Add hover states for the thought bubbles with a mustard yellow glow or pulse. Include a Three.js animated background with floating shapes or soft particles, ensuring it does not interfere with the wireframe layout. The page must be fully responsive and accessible: thought bubbles are keyboard accessible and all images have alt text. Footer and all sections must match the wireframe exactly.",
